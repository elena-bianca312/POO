# Laboratories

This repository contains (and is updated each university year):

 * content of each laboratory with detailed explanations, examples and exercises
 * media, such as photos or diagrams, that are used to better portrait examples as well as sources (where need-be - e.g. the UML diagrams can be exported to XML from [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/))
 * skeletons for laboratories which require a starting point

## Repository folder structure

The structure for a current laboratory is as follows:
```
laboratoare
|
|	--->	lab_name  [1]
|		|	--->	skel  [2]
|		|	--->	media [3]
|		|		|	---> image-source [4]
|		|	lab_name  [5]
|	--->	...
|	--->	...
```

The structure for an old or deprecated laboratory is as follows:
```
old
|
|	--->	old_lab_name  [1]
|		|	--->	skel  [2]
|		|	--->	media [3]
|		|		|	---> image-source [4]
|		|	old_lab_name  [5]
|	--->	...
|	--->	...
```

##### [1] - folder with the laboratory name and contents
##### [2] - folder with the skeleton code [if need-be]
##### [3] - folder with images and diagrams [if need-be]
##### [4] - folder with sources of the images/diagrams [if need-be]
##### [5] - file with laboratory details and exercises -- docuwiki code (**must** be the same as the folder name)
